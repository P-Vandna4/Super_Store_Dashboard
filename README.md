# Super_Store_Dashboard

I have analyzed the dataset of a superstore,

For Creating The Dashboard First I have imported data into Power BI, cleaned the data using power query, created calculated columns and measure using DAX. I have identified the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that are crucial for the business's success. By designing an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard, I have incorporated interactive visualizations and filtering capabilities. This allows users to explore the data at various levels of granularity, enabling them to gain deeper insights into the business operations. I have conducted in-depth data analysis and extracted valuable insights related to the effectiveness of the business's sales strategies. By using charts and visualizations, I have presented this information in a comprehensible and informative manner, helping business entities to make informed decisions. Leveraging historical data, I have applied time series analysis techniques to generate accurate sales forecasts for the next 15 days. These forecasts can aid the business in planning and strategizing to meet future demand and optimize their inventory and resources. 

My ultimate goal is to share valuable insights and actionable information with the stakeholders. By providing data-driven recommendations, I aim to support strategic decision-making processes that align with the supermarket's objectives for growth, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.
